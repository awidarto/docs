title: Culinary Business with COGS module
---
The culinary business, combining restaurant and catering operations, presents a fascinating challenge for enterprise systems due to its high-transaction volume, perishable inventory, and the need to cost complex "recipes" instead of simple items.

Here is a design for the standard modules of a culinary business, followed by a dedicated design for a COGS calculation module.

---

### Core Business Flow

*   **Restaurant:** `Customer Order (POS) -> Kitchen Production (KDS) -> Service -> Payment`
*   **Catering:** `Client Inquiry -> Event Proposal -> Confirmed Booking (BEO) -> Bulk Procurement & Prep -> Event Execution -> Invoicing`
*   **Backend (Universal):** `Recipe Costing -> Menu Engineering -> Inventory & Purchasing -> Financials`

---

### Standard Modules for a Culinary Business

### 1. Module: Recipe & Menu Management

**Purpose:** This is the **Bill of Materials (BOM)** for the culinary world and the absolute foundation of cost control. It breaks down every menu item into its precise ingredients, calculates its cost, and manages menu offerings.

**Key Forms / Processes:**
*   **Recipe Card:** Defines a single dish or component.
*   **Menu Engineering:** Analyzing the profitability and popularity of menu items.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### 2. Module: Inventory Management

**Purpose:** To track all food and beverage stock in real-time. This is critical due to perishability. The module must handle multiple units of measure (e.g., buying potatoes by the 50kg bag, but using them in recipes by the gram).

**Key Forms / Processes:**
*   **Item Master:** Master record for each ingredient.
*   **Stock Count Sheet:** For performing physical inventory counts.
*   **Wastage Log:** To record spoiled, dropped, or expired items.

### 3. Module: Point of Sale (POS) - For Restaurant Operations

**Purpose:** The front-of-house system for taking customer orders, processing payments, and managing tables. It's the primary source of sales data.

**This is a user interface, not a traditional form.** When an order is placed:
1.  It sends the order to the Kitchen Display System (KDS).
2.  It creates a sales transaction record in the background.
3.  Upon payment, it finalizes the transaction, which is then sent to the General Ledger.

---

### 4. Module: Event & Catering Management

**Purpose:** To manage the entire lifecycle of a catering event, from initial quote to final invoice. This acts as the CRM and Project Management hub for the catering side of the business.

**Key Forms / Processes:**
*   **Banquet Event Order (BEO):** The master document for a confirmed catering event.
*   **Catering Invoice:** The final bill sent to the client.

#### **Form Layout: Banquet Event Order (BEO)**

### Module Design: Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Calculation

**Purpose:** This is one of the most critical modules for a culinary business. Its purpose is to calculate the actual cost of ingredients consumed to generate revenue. It provides the data needed to analyze profitability, identify waste, and make pricing decisions.

**Core Logic:** The module works by comparing **Theoretical COGS** (what you *should have* used based on sales and recipes) with **Actual COGS** (what you *actually* used based on inventory counts). The difference is **Variance**, which highlights problems like waste, theft, or incorrect portioning.

#### **Process Flow for COGS Calculation (Typically run weekly or monthly)**

1.  **Data Capture (Automated):**
*   The module continuously pulls **sales data** from the POS and Catering modules. It knows exactly how many "Classic Beef Burgers" were sold.
*   It pulls **purchase data** from the Procurement module.
*   It knows the **cost of each ingredient** from the Inventory module and the **composition of each dish** from the Recipe module.

2.  **Calculate Theoretical COGS:**
*   The system multiplies the number of units sold for each menu item by the theoretical cost on its Recipe Card.
*   *Example:* `150 Burgers Sold * $3.70/burger = $555` in theoretical COGS for that item.
*   It sums this up for all items sold during the period.

3.  **Physical Inventory Count (Manual Task, System-Assisted):**
*   A manager uses a tablet or count sheet generated by the system to perform a physical count of all inventory.
*   They enter the final counts into the system to establish the `Ending Inventory` value.

4.  **Calculate Actual COGS:**
*   The system uses the classic accounting formula:
`Actual COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory`
*   `Beginning Inventory` is simply last period's `Ending Inventory`.

5.  **Generate Variance Report:**
*   The system presents the final, actionable report comparing the two COGS figures.

|   Avocados           | 50 kg             | 58 kg        | $96.00         |

| Interpretation: The total variance of $500 (0.5%) indicates a slight     |
| over-consumption. The item-level detail suggests potential issues with   |
| over-portioning of beef patties and spoilage/waste of avocados.          |
