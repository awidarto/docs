title: Software Consulting
---
Let's expand on the concept of using specific modules for a **consulting and software development firm**.

This type of service-based business has a unique operational flow that differs significantly from a retail or manufacturing company. Its "inventory" is its people's time and expertise. Therefore, the most critical modules revolve around managing projects, tracking time, and billing clients accurately.

Here is a list of standard modules for an enterprise application (like an ERP or PSA - Professional Services Automation tool) tailored for this industry, along with their key forms and layouts.

---

### The "Lead-to-Cash" and Supporting Cycles

The modules in a modern system follow the natural flow of the business. For a consulting firm, this is:

1.  **Win the Work (CRM)**
2.  **Define the Work (Project Management)**
3.  **Do the Work (Time & Expense Tracking)**
4.  **Bill for the Work (Billing & AR)**
5.  **Manage the Costs (AP & Purchasing)**
6.  **Report on Everything (GL & Financials)**

---

### 1. Module: Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

**Purpose:** To manage the sales pipeline from initial lead to a signed contract. It tracks all interactions with potential and existing clients to ensure a smooth transition from sales to the project delivery team.

**Key Forms / Processes:**
*   **Lead Entry:** Capturing a new potential client.
*   **Opportunity Management:** Tracking a potential project, its value, and its probability of closing.
*   **Account & Contact Management:** Central repository for client information.
